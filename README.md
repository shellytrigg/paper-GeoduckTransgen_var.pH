## Experimental Details

### Broodstock conditioning
- After being held at ambient conditions for 8 days (20181121-20181129), broodstock were conditioned under ambient and variable low pH conditions (pH 6.8-7.0) for 48 days beginning 20181129 and ending 20190115.
	- broodstock were sampled for hemolymph twice (on 20181205 and 20190104) during the course of the conditioning. 

- Broodstock were held under ambient conditions for 2 months. 

- Two males and two females from each conditioning group were strip spawned on 20190317. Egg and sperm samples were preserved in liquid N2 and RNA/DNA shield. Hemolymph samples were taken from all individuals prior to strip spawning. Ctenidia and siphon samples from each individual were also preserved in liquid nitrogen.  

### Larval rearing
Larvae from both parental histories were reared in ambient conditions for 32 days from 20190317 to 20190418.
	- respirometry measurements and pooled larvae samples were taken at 5 and 8 time points, respectively throughout rearing. 

### Juvenile rearing
- Setters from both parental histories were moved to heath trays and were held at ambient conditions for 136 days from 20190418 to 20190831. Trays were rotated every week in attempt to remove an effect from tray placement. 
	- photos of juveniles were taken monthly

- Juveniles from both parental histories were transferred to silos on 20190831 and after acclimating for 6 days at ambient conditions, they were reared under ambient and variable low pH (6.8-7.0) for 44 days from 20190905 to 20191018. 
	- respirometry measurements, size measurments and whole individual animal samples were take every two weeks throughout the experiment. 

- Juveniles from both parental histories that were held under the ambient conditions continued to be reared under ambient conditions for 136 days from 20191018 to 20200303.
	- size measurements and counts were taken on 20200303
